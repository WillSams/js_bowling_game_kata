# Bowling Game - A JavaScript TDD Story

The now classic bowling game kata by Bob Martin.  This is a great kata to practice TDD and BDD.  The kata is described in detail within the [Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#][1] book and a slide deck can be found on [Bob Martin's web site][2].

## Specification

Before we write a single line of code, let's write our "specs".  What are we attempting to design?

    1) Scoring basics - 10 frames, 10 pins used for scoring, minimum score is 0 and a max is 300.
    2) Implement basic scoring - 10 frames of 2 rolls each.  Normal rolls are 1 point per pin.
    3) Strikes and spare strikes - 1 roll to knock all 10 are strikes (X), 2 rolls to knock all 10 are spares (/).
    4) Scoring strikes - If first throw, (10+a).  If spare, 10 + a.  Max 30 for first, max 20 for second.
    5) Focus on frames for scoring - score is a sum of individual frames.  Note: strikes causes frame crossover.
    6) Implement spare scoring - Spare scoring crossing frames still count for that frame.
    7) Scoring a strike - Finish implementing logic from #3.
    8) Implement scoring considering strikes - Strike scoring crossing frames still count for that frame.
    9) 10th Frame - If strike or spare is rolled, bowler gets extra ball.  This should make it 21 or less rolls.

## The Kata

I've created a simple shell script that can be followed along on Linux, Mac, or Windows. The script can be read [here][3].

## Prerequisites

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
* [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) - Used to manage NodeJS versions.

## Getting Started

### Install Node.js Packages

Execute the following within your terminal:

```bash
# To eliminate any issues, install/use the version listed in .nvmrc.  
nvm use            

# Install the package needed for testing, jest
npm i  
```

## Testing

The project includes BDD-style tests organized for improved readability and comprehension. While individual preferences may vary, this is my chosen approach for managing tests in this project.

To run the tests, simply enter the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run test
```
